# Flatgas

**Flatgas is a next-generation Layer 1 protocol focused on fee predictability. Built on go-ethereum, it reimagines gas pricing with a fixed-fee model—no spikes, no surprises.**

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build on top of the latest [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) codebase.
- Implement a fixed transaction fee model at the protocol level.
- Enable predictable, stable transaction costs across all network states.
- Explore validator incentives, congestion management, and protocol tuning.

## 🧱 Status

- Repo created ✔️
- go-ethereum fork prepared 🔄
- Gas logic exploration underway 🔍

## 📦 Getting Started

Coming soon: setup instructions for building, running, and testing Flatgas locally.
